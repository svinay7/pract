Practical-2

Aim: 
a) Use CrypTool to encrypt and decrypt passwords using RC4 algorithm

b) Use Cain and Abel for cracking Windows account password using Dictionary attack and
to decode wireless network passwords

Steps:

Step-1) Download the CrypTool and open it

Step-2) Write the text in the above window that you want to encrypt and go to
Encrypt/Decrypt→ Symmetric(modern)→ RC4

After that select the bits

Click on Encrypt

Step-3) To analysis the encryption go to Analysis→ Symmetric 
Encryption(modern)→ RC4

Step-4) Again select the bit but bit should be same as the encryption bit

Click on Start


b) Use Cain and Abel for cracking Windows account password using Dictionary attack
and to decode wireless network passwords

Open Cain & Abel→ Click Hash Calculator→ Enter the Password to Convert

1. Dictionary Attack

a. In the empty field paste the value ou have just converted
b. Right click on the value->dictionary attack-> dialog box will appear
c. Click on file->add to list-> wordlist->chec all the option -> start


2. Brute Force Attack

a. Right click on the value→ brute force attack→ dialog box will appear i.e., given 
below
